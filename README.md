# odin-recipes
First project of The Odin Project: An HTML website for displaying recipes.
I chose three of my favorite vegetarian dishes with general recipes and stock photos.
This project showcases basic HTML knowledge, file creation and manipulation via linux command line and version control via Git and GitHub.
